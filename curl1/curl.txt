Curl is a versatile command-line tool used for transferring data with URLs. It supports various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more.

While cURL isn’t the only way to make API requests, it’s one of the simplest. Just install cURL, open the terminal, and enter your request in the command line. It doesn’t matter what OS you’re using either, since cURL runs on most of them.

The most common use cases for curl are:

Downloading files from the internet
Endpoint testing
Debugging
Error logging
You can customize the cURL command further by incorporating these options:

-X <HTTP_METHOD> — specifies which HTTP method to use.
-H “HeaderName: HeaderValue” — sets custom HTTP headers for the request.
-d “data” — sends data in the request body.
-o <output_file> — saves the response to a file.
-O — saves a remote file.
-i — includes HTTP response headers in the output.
-L — follows HTTP redirects.
-k — allows connections to SSL sites without certificates.
-v — provides verbose output for debugging.
